Object relational mapping (ORM) from C# classes to XML and back.

Create simple C# classes (much like JSON) who's objects can be converted to XML to save records or application settings. 
Later, the object can be re-hydrate from the XML and used like normal.

The motivation for this project was having to create custom XML files for different types of application settings. 
With EntityXml, you can create and work with settings using C# objects and never bother with writing any XML.
